I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Cornell University. I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant at the [Smart Computer Interfaces for Future Interactions (SciFi) Lab](https://www.scifilab.org/) advised by [Prof. Cheng Zhang](http://www.czhang.org/).

My research interest is in combining machine learning with novel sensing approaches to develop new technologies that can promote health monitoring, accessibility, and new interactions with computers and robots through a better understanding of human behaviors.

I am applying for Ph.D. positions for Fall 2024! Please feel free to explore my works and projects. I'm always open to collaboration, discussions, and new ideas!

Aside from research, I am also very interested in aviation and lanscape photography. Feel free to check out my gallery with photos I took during my spare time!
