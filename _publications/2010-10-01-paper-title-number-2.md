In this paper, we present C-Auth, a novel authentication method for smart glasses that explores the feasibility of authenticating users using spatial facial information. Our system uses a down-facing camera in the middle of the glasses to capture facial contour lines from the nose and cheeks. The images captured by the camera are then processed and learned by a customized algorithm for au- thentication. To evaluate the system, we conducted a user study with 20 participants in three sessions on different days. Our system correctly identified the 20 users with a true positive rate of 98.0% (SD: 2.96%) and a false positive rate of 4.97% (2.88 %) across all three days. We conclude by discussing current limitations and challenges as well as the potential future applications for C-Auth.
